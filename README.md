🌍 MigrantConnect

A Unified Digital Platform for Migrant Worker Inclusion


---

📌 Overview

MigrantConnect is a web-based prototype designed to support migrant workers across India by addressing three critical challenges:

1. Language barriers that limit access to services


2. Lack of awareness of government welfare policies


3. Medical exploitation due to missing or fragmented health records



The platform provides a single, trusted digital interface where migrant workers can access personalized welfare schemes, maintain lifelong medical records, and interact with service providers in their preferred language.

This project is developed as a social-impact solution for the Microsoft Imagine Cup.

🎯 Problem Statement

Migrant workers often move across states for employment, facing:

Inability to understand local languages

Difficulty accessing state-specific government schemes

Repeated or unnecessary medical tests due to missing health history

Dependence on intermediaries, increasing risk of exploitation


There is no unified, portable system that ensures continuity of identity, healthcare, and welfare access across regions.


---

💡 Solution

MigrantConnect introduces a unified digital worker profile that travels with the worker across states.

The platform enables:

Multilingual access to information

Transparent and verifiable medical records

Personalized policy recommendations

Ethical, consent-based data sharing


This ensures continuity, trust, and empowerment for migrant workers.


---

🧱 Platform Architecture

The system follows a modular and sequential architecture:

MigrantConnect
│
├── Digital Worker Identity
│
├── Language & Accessibility Module
│
├── Policy & Welfare Access Module
│
├── Medical Records & Doctor Interface
│
└── Trust, Security & Consent Layer

Each module is designed to be scalable, secure, and cloud-ready.
